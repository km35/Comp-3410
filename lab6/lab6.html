		When we really think about it, this image represents the relatively new concept of crowdsourcing, or using the collective computing power of all humans on the internet. to do complex tasks that are still difficult to do with computers. It pokes fun at a supposed overuse of crowdsourcing. by showing an example where crowdsourcing would not be an effective option, but it is being used nonetheless.

		Technically speaking, A captcha of a stop sign doesn't quite describe the image, however, that descriptions works in a pinch. The image has more complexity, such as the captcha using a picture that is supposedly taking place in real time, as an image from a 'self driving' car, which requires the user to complete the captcha quickly so that the car can drive as it should, as the car supposedly cannot figure out if the image is a stop sign or not without internet intervention.
