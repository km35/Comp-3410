Although I did learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in high school, I never felt
like I really had learned enough about it. I still found myself having to look
up many things and having to import other people's code to make my websites
look like I wanted them to.

Ideally in this class I would like to learn how to get a better handle on
creating webpages, so I can do more advanced visuals on my own without as much
reliance on the Internet. I would also like to learn how to do custom styles
on some websites that I use that allow me to do that.

Additionally, if recent happenings with DU WiFi have taught me anything, I would
like to be able to make webpages that work well on extremely slow networks,
such as DU WiFi. I also think that it will be increasingly more important in the
current market for me to have a professional and accurate personal website when
people look me up.
