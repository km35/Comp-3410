		<h3>About:</h3>
		As a frequent player of DnD, current offerings for sites about DnD are often lacking. This site would, if fully developed, be a site that provides various utilities important to playing the game.
		Important features include:
		<ul>
			<li> Stat rolling with a variety of techniques </li>
			<li> Links to various official content</li>
			<li> Automatic dice roller</li>
			<li> Randomly generated character creation ideas</li>
		</ul>
		This was originally going to be a site about a ton of different things, which can still be seen in file names and links. However, I decided that it was probably better for grading and for the site as a whole if I stuck to one topic. The D &amp; D section was the one that I had already put the most work into, and also the one that could most easily fit the other work that was already done. Sadly, this meant that some of my code had to be scrapped, and I lost development time for it. I'm proud of the site I made, but I realize that it may be under par, and I hope that you can take some of these setbacks in to effect while grading.
